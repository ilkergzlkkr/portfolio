Heroes Journey is a simple web-based RPG Game, mainly for learning purposes. It is written in TypeScript and uses the HTML Canvas API.

We built a simple game engine that can be used to create simple RPG games. The engine is based on the Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern.

Our purpose is to create a simple game that is fun to play and can be used to learn the basics of game development. We had a lot of fun building it and we hope you will have fun playing it.

### How to Play

Grab a sword and start your journey. You can move around with the arrow keys and attack with the space bar.

Based on the game mode you choose, you will have to complete different quests. You can choose between the following game modes: `Story` and `PvP`

#### Story Mode

> Story mode supports multiple players, so you can play with your friends.

In story mode, you will have to complete different quests. You can see your current quest in the top left corner of the screen. You can also see your current health and mana points.


### Skills

- **Basic Attack âš”** - Attack your enemies with your sword or any other weapon you have equipped.
  - **Combo Attack âš”âš”âš”** - A series of three attacks that are faster and more powerful than the basic attack.
- **Heavy Attack ðŸ’¥** - Harder, slower, but more powerful attack.
- **Regeneration ðŸ§ª** - Every character has a passive health regeneration. The higher your regeneration, the faster you will heal.
- **Transformation ðŸ§¬** - Transform into a boss-like creature. You will be stronger and faster, but it costs a lot of SP.

## Friends & Fun 

### Everything is Fun (When You Have a Sword)

Playing with friends is always fun. You can play with your friends in the same room or online. You can also play with random people online.
