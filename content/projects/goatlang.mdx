GoatLang is a programming language for the bests. It is a simple language that is easy to learn and use.
> This is a work in progress, the language is not ready yet.

### Syntax

```lua
include "goat/operations.goat"
include "goat/conditions.goat"
include "goat/blueprint.goat"
include "goat/parser.goat"
include "goat/scope.goat"
include "goat/loop.goat"

decl Rabbit(name: str, children_count: int = 0)

    func greet(self) print("Hello, my name is: " + name) end
    func is_parent(self) self.children_count > 0 end
end

let dad Rabbit("Steven", 3) end
let child1 Rabbit("Mark") end

func get_rabbit_name()
    dad.name
end

print("Dad's name is: " get_rabbit_name())

if dad.is_parent()
    print("Dad is a parent with " + dad.children_count + " children")
else
    print("Dad has no children")
end
```

### Features

It is a [`both dynamically and staticly typed`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1517670) language like python, which means that you don't have to specify the type of a variable when you declare it.

```lua
let name = "Steven" end
let age = 20 end
let is_goat = true end
```

It can also be used as a scripting language, here is the simple **calculator** example:

```lua
let a = 20 end
let b = 10 end

print(a + b) -- 30 
print(a - b) -- 10
print(a * b) -- 200
print(a / b) -- 2
```

It can also be used as an **object oriented** language, here is the simple **class** example:

```lua
decl Human(name: str)

    func greet(self) print("Hello, my name is: " + name) end
end
```

It can also be used as a **functional** language, here is the simple **function** example:

```lua
func add(a: int, b: int)
    a + b
end

add(10, 20)
```

It has portals, which are protocols that can be used to communicate with other languages (***only python for now***). Here is the simple **portal** example:

```lua
include "random" with "python"

random.randint(0, 10)
```

Most of languages have **conditions**, and GoatLang is not an exception. Here is the simple **condition** example:

```lua
let condition = true end

if condition
    print("Condition is true")
else
    print("Condition is false")
end
```

> In GoatLang, conditions are expressions, which means that you can assign them to a variable.

```lua
let message if 10 > 20
    "10 is greater than 20"
else if 10 < 20
    "10 is less than 20"
else
    "10 is equal to 20"
end

print(message)
```


### For Developers

GoatLang is interpreted by the python ***for now***, so you need to have python installed on your machine to run it. You can run the language by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python goat.py $file_name
```

#### Roadmap

We are planning to remove [`python`](https://www.python.org) dependency and make the language compiled instead of interpreted. We are planned to use [`LLVM`](https://llvm.org) as the compiler backend. We are also planning to add a package manager for the language.
