Me and my friends needed some app to slow down the song and add reverb to it. Just like trends on TikTok/YouTube. So, i created this app to do that.

You import audio/video files or paste a link to a YouTube video. Then, you can slow down the music as much as you want and add reverb to it. 

### How to use

1. Import audio file or paste a link to a YouTube video.
2. Slow down the music as much as you want.
3. Add reverb to it.
4. Download the music. Done!

## For Developers

At first i made this app with python server that uses [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org) + [`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) + [`spotify/pedalboard`](https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard) with concurrent audio downloading and processing. But it was too slow and i couldn't find a way to make it faster. So i decided to make it **client sided** app

Now, it uses [`Tone.js`](https://tonejs.github.io), no server behind. Check out the [source code](https://github.com/ilkergzlkkr/pyd-pedal-next) for more info.
